I am an enthusiastic electrical and electronics engineering graduate üë∑, I've dived into various tech projects during my college journey. From IoT and Cloud computing to Microcontroller-based systems. One highlight is a practical project in Ceebros Apartments, Chennai, where I crafted a system to cut down on electricity‚ö°Ô∏è bills in real-time. Developed an AgroBot ü§ñ, an autonomous robot built for basic agricultural tasks including pesticide sprinkling, seeding and fruit harvesting.

In the realm of iOS development, I have showcased my skills by creating various iOS apps using Swift in UIKit üë®‚Äçüíª.  I also worked with CAD software Fusion 360 to create 3d models in robotics. I also worked as vice president of iPowerE student chapter in SRM

Eager to contribute my technical skills and innovative mindset, I am actively seeking opportunities üòá. Let's connect and explore how my passion for technology and hands-on experience can contribute to your team's success.
